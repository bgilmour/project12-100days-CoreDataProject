# Project 12 (CoreDataProject)

This is my solution to the CoreDataProject project (project 12) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). This was focussed on introducing new concepts and techniques so there's no app but I did keep all of the various views that we created along the way as well as all of the entities that we added to the data model.

Tackled all three challenges one after the other then took it just a bit further. The FilteredView init now accepts a filterKey and filterValue (as before), an array of sort descriptors, the selected predicate (as an enum), a case sensitivity indicator, and a negation indicator. To make it easier to show the options in action, I modified the Singer view to add a bunch of controls wrapped up in a Form inside a NavigationView.
