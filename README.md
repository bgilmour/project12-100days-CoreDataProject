This is my solution to the CoreDataProject project (project 12) in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)). This was focussed on introducing new concepts and techniques so there's no app but I did keep all of the various views that we created along the way as well as all of the entities that we added to the data model.
